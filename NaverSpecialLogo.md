# NAVER Special Logo

> Year: 2015~2024<br>
Role: Motion Design<br>
Tool: Adobe After Effects<br>
<br>
Naver's special logo is a service that informs users about anniversaries, similar to Google's Doodles.<br>
In this project, I am bringing the author's images to life. By adding dynamic movements to static images, I convey stories to users that the images alone cannot tell.

### Chuseok (Korean Thanksgiving Day)
Chuseok is one of the important holidays in Korea. On this day, families gather to share and enjoy food together. In the special logo, we created a joyful scene where a man and a woman catch falling food together. In this project, I added dynamic movements to the author's illustrations.

### Children's day
In Korea, May 5th is designated as Children's Day, a time for families to enjoy together. To commemorate this day, I worked on a special logo that depicts children blowing bubbles and having a happy time, expressed through motion.

### Frost's Descent​​

I wanted to express the cute appearance of the squirrel through animation.

### Bok-day (The hottest day)
In Korea, there is a culture of eating health food three times on hot summer days. 
To promote this, we worked on a special logo to capture a story in one object (watermelon, ice)
