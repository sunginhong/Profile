## Animate Timeline<br>
https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1390574471920151745/animate-timeline

"Animate Timeline" is a Figma plugin created as a personal project to reduce resource waste caused by repetitive patterns during document work. I was responsible for the product idea and development.

## Android Studio Prototype<br>
Personally, I am also creating an Android prototype using Java.
I have implemented a few ideas

**1. We created a prototype to implement events that react according to the intensity of user gestures.**

**2. Created because I wanted to implement a path that responds to user gestures.**
